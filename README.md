## Phase 1: Improved Description
The user can choose to play with a computer or another friend. The screen will split screen between Player’s 1 turn to Player’s 2 turn, record their answers, and will output who wins that round. The user can choose if they want to play 1 round or best of 3 rounds. There will be a leaderboard to display who has won the most rounds in a row. The count for most wins in a row will reset everytime they lose a round of rock-paper-scissors. We will have a high difficulty mode where the computer will win 100% of the time in a single round for each game. For example, say the player chooses to play a high difficulty mode for a 3 round game against the computer, the computer will win 1 out of 3 games for sure. 
# Phase 1: Project Requirements
1. A URL that renders the home page of the rock paper scissors. 
2. The home page will prompt the play button in the middle of the screen where the game will be prompted when the user clicks on it.
3. There will be advanced game customization options such as how many rounds per game the player would like to play. 
4. Another game customization is who the player wants as an opponent. The user chooses whether they’d  like to play against the computer or against another player.
5. Another game customization that the player can choose is game difficulty. There’s regular difficulty mode and difficult mode against the computer. The difficult mode will result in the computer winning 1 round 100% of the time per game. 
6. The user will input a 4-12 character long username upon entering our webpage which will be stored for the purpose of creating a leaderboard. 
7. The viewport will be split into two: the left side will contain three buttons: “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors” with associated images. 
8. The user must click on the desired rock, paper, or scissors button, and proceed to click “Confirm”.
9. Once confirmed, the opponent on the other half of the screen will be prompted to play their round.
10. The opponent, like the player, has the option to choose rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on their respective button on their side of the screen. 
11. Once both opponents have played their turns, a GUI will display the resulting winner of the round. (i.e, “Player 1 Wins the Round!”). 
12. The process of going from player to opponent choosing and confirming their choice of rock, paper or scissors for the amount of times they choose in the game customization setting. For example, if they choose best out of 3 rounds, the process will go from player to opponent 3 times. 
13. At the end, the player that won the most out of x amount of rounds they choose in the game customization wins the game. If they both win the same number of rounds (through ties), the screen will show that the game result is a tie.
14. Optional: When the player opts in to enter their username, they can be a part of the leaderboard which is sorted by the most number of rounds won in a row. (The most number of rounds won in a row reset every time the player loses a single round.)

# Phase 2: Design

For this phase, we have developed lo-fi wireframes to showcase the design of our interface, and how each page will look like (with respect to content and functionality), and how they will interact with one another (which we have specified through arrows leading from buttons to pages). Here is a link to our submission for this phase and an image of the wireframes (in case there are issues with the link):
